                    <p align="justify">The project focuses on digitizing handwritten prescriptions through sophisticated layout analysis and OCR technologies. Employing a segmented model for precise line-by-line segmentation, it extracts crucial details including unique identification numbers, medication names, frequencies, quantities, and medical histories. An optimized OCR model is utilized for accurate information extraction from handwritten text, while a generative model transforms raw data into structured outputs, enhancing efficiency and precision in medication management and healthcare record-keeping.</p>

                    <p align="justify">This project utilizes the advanced capabilities of the Pegasus Text to Text Generation model to automate the 
                        summarization of employee working contribution logs, aiming to distill key insights efficiently. By inputting verbose logs 
                        into the Pegasus model, concise and coherent summaries are generated that encapsulate the essential points of each entry. 
                        The obtained summaries serve to provide decision-makers with quick overviews of employees' contributions, progress, and challenges. 
                        Through rigorous evaluation using the ROUGE metric, the approach achieves commendable scores, with <b>ROUGE-1 at 0.613, ROUGE-2 at 
                        0.373, ROUGE-L at 0.557, and ROUGE-Lsum at 0.556</b>. These scores attest to the effectiveness of the model in capturing the 
                        essence of the original logs. By integrating Pegasus into the workflow of handling employee logs, organizations stand to streamline 
                        summarization processes, facilitating more efficient decision-making, performance evaluation, and feedback provision while freeing 
                        up valuable time for managerial and HR tasks. </p>
